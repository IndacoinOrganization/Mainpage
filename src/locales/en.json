      "DOGE": "Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency focused on actual utility as a currency. We provide fast block times and very low fees which make Dogecoin suitable for usage in micro-transactions but also as payment option for online shops. Dogecoin has been adopted as such by online retailers and can be used easily as means of consumer to consumer money transfer too.",
      "BTC": "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a digital payment system invented by an unknown programmer, or a group of programmers, under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released as open-source software in 2009. The system is peer-to-peer, and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Since the system works without a central repository or single administrator, bitcoin is called the first decentralized digital currency. Besides being created as a reward for mining, bitcoin can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services in legal or black markets. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment. According to research produced by Cambridge University in 2017, there are 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.",
      "USDT": "USDT is a crypto-currency asset issued on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Omni Layer Protocol. Each USDT unit is backed by a U.S Dollar held in the reserves of the Tether Limited and can be redeemed through the Tether Platform. USDT can be transferred, stored, spent, just like Bitcoins or any other crypto-currency. USDT and other Tether currencies were created to facilitate the transfer of national currencies, to provide users with a stable alternative to Bitcoin and to provide an alternative for exchange and wallet audits which are currently unreliable. USDT provides an alternative to Proof of Solvency methods by introducing a Proof of Reserves Process. In the Tether Proof of Reserves system, the amount of USDT in circulations can be easily checked on the Bitcoin blockchain via the tools provided at Omnichest.info, while the corresponding total amount of USD held reserves is proved by publishing the bank balance and undergoing periodic audits by professionals.",
      "ETH": "Ethereum (ETH) is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality, which facilitates online contractual agreements. Ethereum also provides a cryptocurrency token called \"ether\", which can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed. \"Gas\", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spamand allocate resources on the network. The value token of the Ethereum blockchain is called ether. It is listed under the diminutive ETH and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.",
      "LTC": "Litecoin (LTC) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. Creation and transfer of coins is based on an open source cryptographic protocol and is not managed by any central authority. While inspired by, and in most regards technically nearly identical to Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin has some technical improvements over Bitcoin, and most other major cryptocurrencies, such as the adoption of Segregated Witness, and the Lightning Network. These effectively allow a greater amount of transactions to be processed by the network in a given time, reducing potential bottlenecks, as seen with Bitcoin. Litecoin also has almost zero payment cost and facilitates payments approximately four times faster than Bitcoin",
      "XPR": "Ripple (XRP) is an independent digital asset that is native to the Ripple Consensus Ledger. With proven governance and the fastest transaction confirmation of its kind, XRP is said to be the most efficient settlement option for financial institutions and liquidity providers seeking global reach, accessibility and fast settlement finality for interbank flows.",
      "EOS": "EOS.IO is software that introduces a blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications (the “EOS.IO Software”). This is achieved through an operating system-like construct upon which applications can be built. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores and/or clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that has the potential to scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications."

        "answer3": "If you have waited more than 2 minutes, then the order didn't make it to a transaction. It's possible that your card isn't 3D secure and you may need to try again.

        "question5": "WHY DO I NEED TO VERIFY MY BANKING CARD OR SEND A VIDEO?",

        "question9": "I RECEIVED FEWER COINS THAN WAS PROMISED. WHY?",
        "answer9": "We process the exchange according to the current market rate at the moment when KYC verification is completed and the order is approved. We are trying to make every transaction as profitable as possible for you but the amount that the user receives may differ from originally shown due to sharp jumps in rate.<br>In case, if the amount differs by more than 25 per cent, the user has the right to ask for  a refund by providing a request via support@indacoin.io",
        "question10": "I’VE BEEN CHARGED TWICE. WILL YOU REFUND ME?",

        "question11": "I DIDN’T MAKE AN ORDER ON INDACOIN BUT MY CARD WAS CHARGED. WHAT SHOULD I DO?",
        "answer11": "If your card was stolen and used for the purchase on our platform by another person, please, block your bank card and contact our agent immediately via live-chat support or e-mail  <1>support@indacoin.io</1> for assistance.<br> We kindly ask you to contact us no later than 3 days from the date of purchase, so that immediate action is taken on our side and if possible - a refund."
